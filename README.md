# C++ OOP Questions and Solutions

This repository is a comprehensive collection of C++ questions and detailed solutions focused on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It covers fundamental OOP concepts such as:

Inheritance: Explore various examples and problem sets that illustrate single, multiple, and multilevel inheritance in C++.
Polymorphism: Understand both compile-time (function overloading) and runtime (virtual functions) polymorphism through practical examples.
Encapsulation: Learn how data hiding is implemented in C++ using access specifiers and why itâ€™s vital for robust code.
Abstraction: Delve into abstract classes and interfaces to grasp how abstraction helps in designing flexible and maintainable code.
This resource is ideal for students, self-learners, and anyone looking to deepen their understanding of OOP principles using C++. Each question is accompanied by a clear, step-by-step solution to help you master these concepts.

Questions covered in this repository are :- 

1. Write a C++ program to create a class called "Person" with a name and age attribute. Create two instances of the "Person" class, set their attributes using the constructor, and print their name and age.

2. Write a C++ program to create a class called "Dog" with a name and breed attribute. Create two instances of the "Dog" class, set their attributes using the constructor and modify the attributes using the setter methods and print the updated values.

3. Write a C++ program to create a class called "Rectangle" with width and height attributes. Calculate the area and perimeter of the rectangle.
