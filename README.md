# C++ OOP Questions and Solutions

This repository is a comprehensive collection of C++ questions and detailed solutions focused on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It covers fundamental OOP concepts such as:

Inheritance: Explore various examples and problem sets that illustrate single, multiple, and multilevel inheritance in C++.
Polymorphism: Understand both compile-time (function overloading) and runtime (virtual functions) polymorphism through practical examples.
Encapsulation: Learn how data hiding is implemented in C++ using access specifiers and why itâ€™s vital for robust code.
Abstraction: Delve into abstract classes and interfaces to grasp how abstraction helps in designing flexible and maintainable code.
This resource is ideal for students, self-learners, and anyone looking to deepen their understanding of OOP principles using C++. Each question is accompanied by a clear, step-by-step solution to help you master these concepts.
